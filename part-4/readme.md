The purpose of this exercise was to show us that we can create workers and separate threads to avoid having all of our functions run on a single thread which could lead to us slowing down the speed at which our websites or functions operate at.
This is done by sharing with us that even though the function of generating prime numbers is happening through the use of a worker, we are still able to type in a textbox and alter other things without the need for that action to be completed. It will simply happen asynchronously.
What we were just introduced to was a dedicated worker which only has one primary function. There are other types of workers that are shared or service.
